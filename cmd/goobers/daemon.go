// (issue #23 AC: restart via Runner.Resume). "Interrupted" is exactly
// journal.PhaseRunning in the event log: no run.finished event has landed.
// Resume itself is idempotent on an already-terminal run and safe to call on
// one that merely paused gracefully (a human gate, or a prior clean drain),
// not only a genuine crash — so this scan doesn't need to distinguish those
// cases itself; a gate-paused run's Resume call returns almost immediately
// (walk re-checkpoints at the same gate without evaluating anything), so its
// reserved slot (below) is held only briefly, not for the daemon's lifetime.
// Runs already terminal in their event log are not resumed, but their claims
// and any reconciled concurrency slot are released idempotently to keep the
// reconciliation and resume passes in agreement.
//
// release is called with each recovered run and workflow — immediately for a
// terminal run, or once a resumed run's Resume call returns (success or
// error). Scheduler.ReleaseReconciled only releases runs actually seeded by
// Reconcile, so terminal cleanup cannot consume another run's slot.
//
// A run whose workflow or gaggle no longer resolves in the current config
// (renamed or removed, issue #135 point 2) is skipped with a warning journaled
// to log, not a fatal error — a stale run must never prevent the daemon from
// starting; recovering it is `goobers run abort <run-id>` (abort.go).
//
// Each resumed run also incrementally ingests into rollupDB once its outcome
// is known (issue #127), the same hook trackedStarter.Start uses for a live
// dispatch — a resumed run's spans/errors/stage_attempts must show up in
// `goobers telemetry` too, not just a freshly-dispatched one's. tel is
// flushed first (issue #129), same ordering rationale as
// trackedStarter.Start — the batched span exporter must write spans.jsonl to
// disk before ingest reads it.
//
// A run whose run.yaml names a driver other than this process's runner
// (journal.RunIdentity.EngineDriven) is never resumed: it is re-attached
// instead — the scan journals a run.recovery annotation with action
// "reattached" and hands the run to reattachEngineRun, which waits on the
// engine's workflow. See enginerunguards.go for why "resume it anyway" is a
// duplicate-driver bug rather than a redundant safety net.

// had not created yet. `goobers up` failed with "walk /var/lib/goobers/config:
// no such file or directory", and `goobers apply` — the one-shot reconcile that
// would populate it — requires the live daemon that was refusing to start. The
// component that fetches config needed the daemon, and the daemon needed the
// config it had not fetched.
//
// Creating the directory is not enough on its own, and finding that out is the
// point: an empty tree fails validation with exactly one error, CFG002 "no
// Manifest object found in config directory". So the seed is a minimal
// zero-gaggle Manifest — the same artifact operators were hand-writing to get
// past this, now shipped so an adopter following the docs does not have to
// invent it. The daemon already accepts a zero-gaggle instance, and the first
// reconcile replaces the seed with the tracked tree.
//
// Deliberately narrow, in three ways:
//
//   - Only for a git workflowSource. With no remote source configured nothing
//     would ever populate the tree, so a missing config directory stays a hard
//     startup failure: a daemon serving an empty instance forever is worse than
//     one that says why it will not start.
//   - Only when the directory is ABSENT. An existing tree, even an invalid or
//     empty one, is left exactly as it is — this must never overwrite config an
//     operator or a previous sync put there.
//   - The seed names no gaggle, so it cannot schedule anything before the real
