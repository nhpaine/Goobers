// remediation can and should fix it.

// they were ordering concerns and not defects — failed the every-finding test
// and was dispatched to remediation, which reproduced the identical diff. The

// WHAT ELECTION MEANS. Being elected does not mean "merge this regardless of
// review". It means "stop counting those siblings as blockers." And once that
// is said out loud, the verdict follows deterministically rather than by fiat:
// every finding was a pure ordering ask (allCrossPRBlocked — the PR is
// individually fine and merely waiting its turn), and this PR is the one whose
// turn it is. There is no defect left to fix, so there is nothing for
// `needs-changes` to describe. The decision is derived, not overridden. The
// same reasoning now also covers a PR whose reviewer verdict is ALREADY a
// genuine pass (resolveElectionOutcome below): sharing a deterministic
// overlap with a live sibling means it is not automatically its cluster's
// lander either, and #1071 requires that to be resolved before it reaches
// merge-pr, exactly like the needs-changes case.
//
// WHY NOT THE PREVIOUS SHAPE. elect-gate's pass branch used to route straight
// to merge-pr, deliberately bypassing this stage — which produced three
// problems at once:
//
//  1. merge-pr builds its commit message from a `pass` verdict comment pinned
//     to the current head/base SHA (structuredMergeCommitMessage, mergepr.go).
//     The bypass means no verdict comment is ever posted on this path and the
//     verdict was needs-changes anyway, so that lookup finds nothing and
//     merge-pr exits 1 — a hard stage failure, every cycle, for as long as the
//     cluster exists. The elected path could not actually merge anything.
//  2. merge-pr's "was this reviewed favorably" conjunct compares against the
//     workflow's hardcoded `verdict: "pass"` input rather than the real
//     verdict, so on this path the safety check was satisfied by a constant
//     string.
//  3. An about-to-merge PR published no verdict at all, so nothing recorded
//     why it merged.
//
// Deriving the pass here fixes all three by construction: the ordinary
// apply-verdict -> published-verdict -> merge-pr path now carries a real,
// SHA-pinned pass verdict comment, and no separate merge authority exists.
// It also costs no extra cycle — the PR still merges on this pass.
//
// Requiring an independent `pass` verdict instead would deadlock the exact
// situation election exists to break: mutually-blocked PRs cannot each earn a
// pass while each is waiting on the other.
//
// The findings are deliberately left intact on the published verdict. The
// ordering asks were real observations and stay visible; only the decision they
// rolled up to changes, and the rationale states exactly why.

// preserveReviewerRationale keeps the policy explanation first for legacy
// no-lander consumers, without dropping or truncating the underlying review.
