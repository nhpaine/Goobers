//
// WHY AN ADAPTER RATHER THAN A RESHAPE OF EngineDeps.
//
// bootstrap.EngineDeps holds single interface values — one Goober, one Det —
// constructed once per process. The local runner's equivalent seams are per-RUN
// FACTORIES (runner.NewDeterministicFunc / NewAgenticFunc) because an executor
// binds its ArtifactRecorder at construction time and must not be shared across
// runs. Those two shapes do not meet.
//
// They do not have to. Every activity hands the seam an InvocationEnvelope, and
// the envelope carries RunID and Gaggle — so one long-lived value can dispatch
// to a per-run executor on each call. That keeps the change additive: neither
// internal/engine nor internal/bootstrap is touched, and the executors used are
// the SAME ones the local runner builds, from the same buildRunnerConfig, which
// is what conformance between the two tiers rests on.
