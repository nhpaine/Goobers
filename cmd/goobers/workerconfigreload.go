// workerConfigReloadInterval is the default cadence `goobers worker` re-reads
// its config tree at.
//
// WHY THE WORKER WATCHES ITS OWN TREE AT ALL (#3884).
//
// The worker used to build every agentic kit — goober instructions, gaggle
// config, credential grants — from the config tree as it stood when the
// process started, and never looked again. The daemon, by contrast, syncs its
// tree live. When the two diverged (Infra LEDGER I-51: a worker one Workflows
// revision behind the daemon for 32 minutes) every stage the worker served
// resolved credentials against the STALE gaggle, found no binding for the
// retargeted project, fell back to the first binding, and produced a
// wrong-credential clone failure — with nothing in run.yaml to show it.
//
// Polling, not fs notification, deliberately: the tree the worker reads is a
// mounted/seeded directory whose updates arrive as whole-directory swaps and
// atomic renames rather than as a predictable event stream, and inotify does
// not survive the symlink swap a projected ConfigMap volume performs. A cheap
// content digest (configDirectoryDigest — the daemon's own) makes the steady
// state a directory walk that changes nothing, and makes the change signal
// content-based rather than timestamp-based.
const workerConfigReloadInterval = 10 * time.Second

// workerReloadOutcome reports what a single reload check did. It is the
// worker's equivalent of configReloader.pollOnce's structured result: callers
// (the watcher's log line, tests) need to tell "nothing changed" from
// "applied" from "the tree was moving" without re-deriving any of it.

	// Applied is true when a new snapshot was published.
