# Daemon supervision (systemd · launchd · Windows Service)

Runs the `goobers` daemon through a stable, auto-restarting service host that
launches `goobers up` from the instance's mutable binary slot. This
resolves **DEP-Q6** (`docs/requirements/deployment.md`): tier 1–2 daemon
supervision is **systemd** on Linux, **launchd** on macOS, and a **Windows
Service** wrapper on Windows.

Use the native CLI on an initialized instance:

```sh
goobers service install /absolute/path/to/instance
goobers service status  /absolute/path/to/instance
goobers service stop    /absolute/path/to/instance
goobers service start   /absolute/path/to/instance
goobers service uninstall /absolute/path/to/instance
```

`install` registers, enables, and starts the daemon with crash restart and
backoff configured. `uninstall` drives the graceful shutdown contract before
removing the registration. `status --json` exposes the same state for scripts.
An existing registration is not overwritten; uninstall it first when changing
the stable host binary or instance path. Product updates keep the registration.

`stop`/`start` (#2073) halt and resume the daemon without touching that
registration — the goobers-native equivalent of the platform sections'
`systemctl stop`/`launchctl stop`/`sc.exe stop` (and their `start` pairs)
below, useful for a maintenance window that shouldn't require reinstalling.
Both are idempotent: stopping an already-stopped (or starting an
already-running) daemon succeeds as a no-op. The platform sections below
document the generated registration and its native supervisor commands for
troubleshooting.

**One shutdown contract, three triggers.** The daemon has a single
graceful-shutdown path: cancel the root context, stop admitting work, drain
in-flight runs, then exit. **The drain is unbounded by default** — `goobers up`
waits indefinitely for admitted runs to finish, because an admitted run holds a
live agentic session and a worktree. `--drain-timeout <duration>` opts into a
deadline (`cmd/goobers/up.go`; `goobers status` reports `drain-timeout=unbounded`
when unset). Each supervisor drives that same path:

| Platform | Stop trigger | Reaches the graceful path via |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (systemd) | `systemctl stop` | `SIGTERM` (systemd default `KillSignal`) |
| macOS (launchd) | `launchctl bootout` | `SIGTERM` (launchd unload) |
| Windows (service) | `sc stop` / service stop | `SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP` → context cancel (`internal/winsvc`) |

A second SIGTERM/SIGINT force-exits immediately (the wedged-shutdown backstop in
`internal/signals`); the supervisors' hard-kill timeouts below are the final
fallback beyond that.

## Supervised self-update

The hourly workflow defaults to a checksum-verified release; `manual` pins a tag and
`on-main` builds the API-pinned commit. Candidates pass version, validation, and
config-diff checks. The host journals activation, retains the old binary, and rolls
back with escalation on failed health. Config delivery remains owned by Workflow CD.

### Knowing an update exists

A running daemon checks the product release source at startup and every
`updateCheck.interval` (default 24h) and prints one line when the newest
release on its channel is ahead of the running build:

```
update available: v0.5.0 (running v0.4.0) — run `goobers self-update` to stage it
```

On an instance without `goobers service install` the notice names
`goobers service install` instead, because `self-update` refuses without the
supervised binary slot. `goobers status` renders the same answer from the
daemon's cache (`<root>/updates/check.json`) and makes no request of its own.

That sentence is announced once per discovered version. Because a single line
scrolls out of `journalctl` behind the per-minute heartbeat, the heartbeat also
carries a compact clause for as long as the build is behind (#4920):

```
[15:04:05] alive — 3 workflow(s), 0 trigger(s) fired, …; mem…; cpu…; update v0.5.0 available
```

The clause disappears once the running build is current, and `--quiet`
suppresses it along with the rest of the heartbeat.

The check is **notify-only** (INST-020): it never stages or applies anything,
and a release source that is unreachable warns once and changes nothing about
the daemon's health. A version is announced once, not once per tick.

Configure it in `instance.yaml`:

```yaml
updateCheck:
  enabled: true       # default; false makes this path do no network request
  channel: stable     # stable | prerelease — the same channels self-update stages
  interval: 24h
```

`channel: prerelease` is the persistent equivalent of `self-update`'s
`--include-prerelease`, which is otherwise reachable only by editing a stage's
command line.

## Linux (systemd)

Template: [`packaging/systemd/goobers.service`](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/blob/main/packaging/systemd/goobers.service)
(a **user** service — recommended, so it runs as you with your credentials).

**Native equivalent of `goobers service install`:**

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp packaging/systemd/goobers.service ~/.config/systemd/user/goobers.service
# Fill in the two placeholders: %GOOBERS_BIN% and %INSTANCE_ROOT%
$EDITOR ~/.config/systemd/user/goobers.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now goobers
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"        # keep running after logout / across reboots
```

**Operate:**

```sh
systemctl --user start   goobers      # start (goobers service start)
systemctl --user stop    goobers      # graceful stop, unit stays enabled (goobers service stop)
systemctl --user status  goobers      # status
journalctl --user -u goobers -f       # logs (follow)
```

**Upgrade:** use `self-update`; reinstall the service only to replace its stable
host.

`TimeoutStopSec=infinity` in the template lets the unbounded drain finish
instead of letting systemd escalate to `SIGKILL` mid-run. **Do not copy a finite
value into it unless you also set `goobers up --drain-timeout`** — a shorter
systemd deadline kills in-flight worker processes and loses the run. If you do
bound the drain, make `TimeoutStopSec` slightly longer than `--drain-timeout`. A
second `SIGTERM` still force-exits immediately (`internal/signals`), so an
operator always has an escape hatch.

For a **system-wide** install instead, drop the unit in
`/etc/systemd/system/`, add `User=`/`Group=`, and use `systemctl` without
`--user` (you own credential delivery to that user).

## macOS (launchd)

Template: [`packaging/launchd/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers.plist`](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/blob/main/packaging/launchd/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers.plist)
(a per-user **LaunchAgent**).

**Native equivalent of `goobers service install`:**

```sh
cp packaging/launchd/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers.plist \
   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers.plist
# Fill in the placeholders: %GOOBERS_BIN%, %INSTANCE_ROOT%, %LOG_DIR%
$EDITOR ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers.plist
launchctl enable gui/$(id -u)/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers
```

**Operate:**

```sh
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers   # status
launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers      # (re)start (goobers service start)
launchctl stop gui/$(id -u)/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers           # graceful stop, stays loaded (goobers service stop)
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.agent-clubhouse.goobers        # graceful stop + unload (goobers service uninstall)
tail -f "$LOG_DIR"/goobers.err.log                                # logs
```

**Upgrade:** use `self-update`; reinstall the LaunchAgent only to replace its
stable host.

`ExitTimeOut=45` bounds the drain before launchd sends `SIGKILL`;
`KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false` restarts on crashes without fighting an operator
stop.

> **Known asymmetry (macOS).** The systemd unit waits indefinitely
> (`TimeoutStopSec=infinity`), but the packaged LaunchAgent still bounds the
> drain at 45 seconds. On macOS, a `launchctl bootout`/`stop` while an agentic
> stage is running can therefore reach `SIGKILL` before the run drains. Until
> the plist is reconciled, either stop the daemon when no run is in flight
> (`goobers status`), or raise `ExitTimeOut` in your own copy of the plist
> (`0` means wait indefinitely) so it matches the daemon's default.

## Windows (per-user Scheduled Task)

Use the per-user Scheduled Task when Goobers must retain the logged-in user's
GitHub CLI accounts, harness sessions, Credential Manager entries, and user
environment:

```powershell
goobers service task-install C:\path\to\instance
goobers service task-status  C:\path\to\instance
goobers service task-stop    C:\path\to\instance
goobers service task-start   C:\path\to\instance
goobers service task-uninstall C:\path\to\instance
```

`task-install` registers an interactive, limited-privilege task for the current
user, starts it immediately, and triggers it again at user logon. The task has
no execution-time limit and retries a failed supervisor three times at
one-minute intervals. A daemon crash therefore returns failure and activates
that retry policy. A clean daemon exit, including the drain requested by
`goobers down`, returns success and remains stopped.

The task launches a hidden, non-interactive Windows PowerShell host that waits
for `__service-supervise` and propagates its exit code. This keeps Task Scheduler
attached to the supervisor for stop, restart, and failure-retry behavior without
opening a persistent console or Windows Terminal tab.

The task runs the stable `__service-supervise` host, so self-update activation,
health monitoring, and rollback use the same mutable binary layout as the other
platform supervisors. Product upgrades use `goobers self-update`; do not replace
the active `updates\current\goobers.exe` directly.

---

## Windows (Windows Service)

The stable host uses [`internal/winsvc`](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/tree/main/internal/winsvc) to translate SCM
stop/shutdown controls into supervisor cancellation, then writes the same
cross-platform daemon drain request used for update handoffs.

Run `goobers service install <instance-root>` from an elevated PowerShell or
Command Prompt. Its native equivalent is below. First put
`goobers.exe` on disk — download and verify a release per the
[Windows quickstart](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/blob/main/docs/guides/quickstart-windows.md), placing it at
`C:\Program Files\goobers\goobers.exe` (the path the service below references):

```powershell
# Create the service (note the spaces after '=' in sc.exe syntax):
sc.exe create goobers binPath= "\"C:\Program Files\goobers\goobers.exe\" __service-supervise \"C:\ProgramData\goobers\instance\"" start= auto DisplayName= "Goobers daemon"
sc.exe description goobers "Goobers agent-workforce daemon (scheduler + local runner)"
sc.exe failure goobers reset= 86400 actions= restart/5000/restart/30000/restart/60000
sc.exe failureflag goobers 1
sc.exe start goobers
```

**Operate:**

```powershell
sc.exe query   goobers      # status
sc.exe stop    goobers      # graceful stop, registration kept (goobers service stop)
sc.exe start   goobers      # start (goobers service start)
sc.exe delete  goobers      # uninstall (stop first) (goobers service uninstall)
```

Logs go to the console the SCM captures; use the daemon's own journal
(`goobers trace`, `goobers status --daemon`) for run-level detail. Configure the
service account (`sc.exe config goobers obj= …`) so the daemon runs as the user
whose credentials the instance references.

> **Status.** The required Windows CI gate builds and vets the full binary on a
> native Windows runner and runs the `internal/winsvc` transition tests on
> every pull request, merge group, and push to main. Native Service Control
> Manager lifecycle verification — install, start, query, stop, and uninstall
> of the packaged service — remains open in
> [#2438](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/2438).

## Service health record (#5244)

Alongside the fast informational heartbeat on stdout (which is unchanged and
still one minute), the daemon appends a durable `service.health` event to
`scheduler/events.jsonl` **at startup and every six hours thereafter**, whether
or not any workflow is running. It answers "what is this instance, running as
which account, since when" without needing a run to hang the question off — no
workflow run is fabricated and no artificial long-lived task is held open to
represent an idle instance.

The record is not silenced by `--quiet`: that flag suppresses stdout chatter,
while this is evidence read back from the log later.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | Payload shape version; read it before interpreting the rest. |
| `observedAt` | When the observation was taken. |
| `instanceId` | The durable instance identity, or `unknown`. |
| `identityProblem` | Present only when the identity could not be read, explaining why. |
| `machineName` | Host name, or `unknown`. |
| `accountName` | The account the **service** is executing as — not the interactive observer. |
| `daemonStartedAt` / `processUptimeSeconds` | This process's lifetime. Absent when no daemon identity is available. |
| `observedUncleanRestarts` | Count of recorded `daemon.dirty_restart` events in the readable window. |
| `observationWindowStart` | Earliest event actually read — after log rotation this is later than the daemon's start. |
| `windowCoverage` | `complete` when the history was readable, `unknown` when it was not. |

Two deliberate limits on what the record claims:

- **Zero means a covered empty window.** The restart count is reported *only*
  when `windowCoverage` is `complete`; an unreadable window omits the field
  entirely rather than reporting zero, so "none happened" and "nothing was
  measured" never look alike.
- **The names do not over-claim.** An unclean restart means the previous lock
  was not cleanly released, which is not automatically a confirmed crash; and
  `processUptimeSeconds` is this process's lifetime, not cumulative healthy
  availability across restarts.

Export of this record to an OpenTelemetry collector is **not** implemented. It
needs the separately configurable operational-diagnostics stream tracked by
#5243, whose whole point is that configuring a workflow-journal destination must
not silently start exporting machine and account labels. The record is local
evidence until that lands.

## Dirty restart journal event

Every daemon lifetime appends `daemon.started` and a successful graceful drain
appends `daemon.clean_shutdown` to `scheduler/events.jsonl`. If the supervisor
restarts Goobers after an abrupt termination, the persistent `scheduler/up.lock`
has no matching clean-shutdown event. Startup then appends
`daemon.dirty_restart` with reason
`previous daemon lock remained without a clean-shutdown event` and includes the
previous daemon identity under `runner`.
