# Goobers Kubernetes reference manifests

Reference expression of [docs/design/k8s-infra-shape.md](../../docs/design/k8s-infra-shape.md)
(deliverable K2, issue #663) — the manifests a customer **applies and adapts** on a cluster
they procure and operate. This is *reference, not managed IaC*: Goobers does not apply,
sync, or reconcile these files at runtime, and provisioning code (Bicep/Terraform, cloud
accounts) is explicitly out of scope per the shape doc's status header. The quarantined
`infra/` tree is unrelated and stays quarantined.

Before rollout, review the [control-plane network contract](goobers-system/NETWORKING.md).
The base is deny-first; proxy, collector and cluster-specific API/ingress paths
require explicit adopter configuration, not a broad egress bypass.

Every manifest carries a comment citing the shape-doc section it implements, so drift
between the doc and these files is greppable (`grep -rn 'k8s-infra-shape' deploy/reference`).

## Layout

| Path | Contents | Shape doc |
|---|---|---|
| `goobers-system/` | kustomize base: operator, worker, daemon API + portal, RBAC, RWO instance storage, RWX artifact storage; the API Service exposes the canonical blob-plane port from `internal/netpolrender.DefaultBlobEndpoint().Port` (currently `8080`) | §2, §3, §4, §5 |
| `gaggle-namespace/base/` | per-gaggle namespace template: namespace, identity-annotated ServiceAccount, deny-first NetworkPolicies, dispatcher RBAC for the worker's mode-3 pod-per-stage seam | §3, §5 |
| `gaggle-namespace/examples/` | two example gaggle overlays (`gaggle-a`, `gaggle-b`) stamping the template | §3, §5 |
| `temporal/` | values for the OSS Temporal Helm chart + kustomize base (Temporal-isolation NetworkPolicies + the namespace-registration Job) | §2, §4, §5 |

## Hand-managed node-pool contract

The reference deployment assumes that the cluster operator creates and manages its node
pools. It relies on pool properties, not particular VM sizes, node counts, purchase
models, or scaling limits:

| Pool | Required node properties | Workload placement |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (required) | Linux kubelet OS and the standard `kubernetes.io/os=linux` label | Normal Goobers workloads, including the operator, worker, API, and Temporal components, select `kubernetes.io/os: linux`. No Goobers-specific taint or toleration is required. |
| Windows (optional) | Windows kubelet OS, the standard `kubernetes.io/os=windows` label, and the operator-applied `kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule` taint | Windows stage workloads select `kubernetes.io/os: windows` and tolerate the matching `NoSchedule` taint. Do not add this toleration to Linux workloads. |

AKS supplies the OS label but does **not** automatically taint Windows pools. Apply the
taint when creating a Windows pool, and preserve it when replacing or adding nodes:

```sh
kubectl taint node <windows-node> kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule
```

## Temporal bring-up order

The OSS Temporal Helm chart stands up a cluster with **no namespaces registered** — every
"Temporal is healthy" check (pods Running, frontend reachable) passes while the
worker/engine still dies with `Namespace default is not found` (#4287). Registering the
namespace is a required step, not follow-up hardening; bring the stack up in this order:

1. Create the customer-managed PostgreSQL `temporal-postgres-credentials` Secret
   (`temporal/values.yaml`'s `existingSecret:` references).
2. Install the chart (`temporal/values.yaml` header carries the pinned `helm install`
   command).
3. Apply `kubectl apply -k deploy/reference/temporal` (the namespace-registration Job
   plus both Temporal-isolation NetworkPolicies — #4827 split frontend's external
   control-plane grant from the intra-cluster RPC/ringpop grant every server component
   needs from every other, so applying either alone leaves the other traffic denied)
   and wait for the Job to complete
   (`kubectl wait --for=condition=complete -n goobers-temporal job/goobers-temporal-namespace`).
   The Job is idempotent — safe to reapply on every chart upgrade or cluster rebuild.
4. Bring up `goobers-system/` (worker/engine connect to the namespace the Job just
   registered).

`namespace-job.yaml`'s `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`/`RETENTION` env vars are the single source for
those values — `goobers-system/worker-deployment.yaml`'s Temporal env and this Job's
`TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE` must name the same namespace (both default to
`internal/instance/config.go`'s `DefaultTemporalNamespace`, `"default"`, unless overridden).
`goobers doctor --k8s` checks the configured namespace actually exists (`temporal-namespace`
check, `internal/k8spreflight/checks.go`).

Karpenter and AKS Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) remain deferred, and whether an
autoprovisioner is wanted at all is a separate open decision. The pod-per-stage
execution model does exist — the `internal/dispatcher` dispatcher (#3513) runs one
pod per stage, so unschedulable stage pods are an available scaling signal — but no
autoprovisioning policy has been chosen, sized, or validated against it here. Until
that decision is taken, operators choose and manage capacity for both pools according
to their own workloads; this reference sets no fixed capacity, VM SKU, spot policy, or
scale-to-zero default.

## Conventions

- **`CHANGE-ME`** marks every value the customer must replace (registry, hosts,
  storage class, identity client ids). Nothing here references a real registry or tenant.
  In fields that carry a declared name format (RFC-1123 labels/subdomains such as
  `ingressClassName`, `storageClassName`, and `metadata.name`) the placeholder is
  spelled lowercase `change-me`: an uppercase one is *syntactically* invalid, so the
  API server rejects the whole `kubectl apply -k` instead of just leaving that one
  field unbound (#3310). `make deploy-validate` lints these formats
  (`TestDeployReferenceNamedFieldsAreFormatValid`), because kustomize renders and
  kubeconform checks schema — neither checks a value against its own field's format.
  Stage egress CIDRs are NOT hand-edited here any more: they are rendered per runner
  class by `goobers netpol-render` from `instance.yaml egress.allowlist` (issue #3568,
  decision 016 — the rendered output is the only authoritative copy, and the render
  refuses unfilled documentation-CIDR placeholders instead of shipping stubs).
- **Image**: containers reference the image name `goobers`; the kustomize `images:`
  transformer in each kustomization rewrites it to your registry. Build the image with
  `make image` (packaging/docker/Dockerfile) and push it to a registry the cluster can
  pull from (§1) — Goobers does not publish images yet (CI publishing is a follow-up).
  The image includes Node.js, GitHub CLI, and the Copilot CLI default agent harness, so
  the reference worker can run deterministic and agentic stages.
- **Mixed-OS safety**: the Linux control-plane workloads are pinned with
  `kubernetes.io/os: linux`. In a cluster with Windows nodes, also taint every Windows
  node so an unpinned Linux workload cannot attach and initialize a Linux volume there:

  ```sh
  kubectl taint node <win-node> kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule
  ```

  `NoSchedule` does not evict existing pods, so this is safe on a live cluster. Windows
  workloads must select `kubernetes.io/os: windows` and carry the matching toleration:

  ```yaml
  tolerations:
    - key: kubernetes.io/os
      operator: Equal
      value: windows
      effect: NoSchedule
  ```

  If you choose an in-cluster CloudNativePG database instead of the recommended managed
  PostgreSQL service, pin its Linux pods through the `Cluster` scheduling field (not a pod
  template):

  ```yaml
  spec:
    affinity:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
  ```
- **CRDs**: initial CRD install is a cluster-admin action (§1) from the operator release
  you deploy. The committed `config/crd/bases` are generated from `api/v1alpha1`; update
  them with `make manifests`. The merge gate regenerates the CRDs and rejects any diff.
- **Configuration scaffolding, not a runnable mode-3 installation**: the worker
  flags are implemented, but its seed only creates empty directories. An adopter
  must supply `instance.yaml`, the complete config tree, runner inventory, and
  credentials. The API Deployment remains disabled (`replicas: 0`); its Service
  consequently has no backend. Off-loopback TLS and signed pod authentication
  are implemented, but this base does not configure them. The worker also lacks
  its daemon/blob endpoints and shared signing key. It now refuses this incomplete
  dispatch configuration at startup, before polling or creating stage pods.
  The operator Deployment is also disabled (`replicas: 0`); configure and validate
  its runtime image and adopted topology before enabling it.

### Mode-3 authority and storage prerequisites

The opt-in [authenticated topology preparer](authenticated/README.md) produces a
self-contained single-gaggle deployment with separate writable state, shared blobs,
immutable config rollouts, authenticated endpoints, and explicit network grants.
It requires validated adopter configuration and the documented external inputs.

A configured deployment needs all of these inputs before enabling stage dispatch:

- Run the daemon as the sole owner of its writable instance/journal volume, in
  its own Deployment and ServiceAccount. Set `api.listen`, `api.tls.certFile`,
  `api.tls.keyFile`, and `api.podTokenKeyFile` in its instance configuration.
  A pod-only listener can use signed pod authentication without a human OIDC
  provider; enabling human access requires its own supported authentication.
- Give the worker `--daemon-api` (or `GOOBERS_DAEMON_API`) and
  `GOOBERS_BLOB_ENDPOINT`, normally both
  `https://goobers-api.goobers-system.svc:8080`, and the same signing key through
  its own `api.podTokenKeyFile`. These must be absolute HTTP(S) base URLs without
  user information, query parameters, or fragments. Startup validates syntax
  and key material, not endpoint reachability or remote key agreement. Use TLS
  for the in-cluster listener. The certificate must cover the Service name;
  workers and **all stage images** must trust its CA. Successful kubelet HTTPS
  probes alone do not establish client trust.
- Share the RWX blob volume: the daemon's `<instance>/blobstore` and the worker's
  `--blob-store` must refer to the same backing tree, including its `surrender/`
  directory. Stage pods use the authenticated network planes, never the PVC.
- Give the worker its **own writable instance root** and private `--work-root`,
  with matching config supplied through a whole mounted config tree or a
  maintained sync source. `--work-root` alone does not relocate all writes:
  workspace setup constructs per-gaggle worktree managers under the instance,
  and local execution stages artifacts there. A read-only mount of the daemon's
  whole instance is therefore insufficient. RWO same-node affinity does not
  solve state ownership. See the reload section below for propagation and pin
  retention requirements; copying config once does not provide live sync.
- Add explicit deny-first network grants for worker-to-daemon, worker-to-Kubernetes
  API, worker-to-Temporal, and stage-to-daemon traffic, with DNS available.
  Retain namespace **and** pod selectors on cross-namespace blob/API grants.
  Keep pod-creation RBAC on the worker ServiceAccount and out of the daemon's
  ServiceAccount. The base does not supply adopter-specific API-server addresses
  or a fully connected authority topology.

Do not enable the API beside the worker while both use the base's same writable
instance PVC. The manifests require an adopter overlay implementing the ownership
and configuration above, followed by an actual authenticated stage execution,
artifact retrieval, surrender, and restart test. Static manifest validation does
not demonstrate those runtime properties.

## Validation

No cluster is required. The merge gate runs `make deploy-validate`, which renders every
kustomization under `deploy/reference/` — including `temporal/` (#4827: this tree had
no `kustomization.yaml` and was never rendered or schema-checked, which is why its
NetworkPolicy shipped denying Temporal's own intra-cluster RPC) — and passes them
through strict kubeconform schema validation. The Go test suite also checks every
Deployment's container arguments against the registered CLI flags, requires
execution-critical worker flags such as `--instance`, and (#4827) asserts that no
reference NetworkPolicy selects pods from a chart release without also admitting
that release's own required intra-cluster traffic.

A stage pod's Go module cache is not mounted under `/tmp`: each gaggle namespace
supplies a dedicated RWX persistent volume at `/var/goobers/cache`, exported as
`GOMODCACHE`, so concurrent fresh stage pods reuse downloaded modules. `GOCACHE`
continues to live under the attempt-private `tmp:ephemeral` root at `/tmp`, so
the #3969 growth bound remains in force. Without the separate module-cache
volume, a stage pod starts every build cold and spends its budget re-downloading
modules. The PVC's 20Gi request is the documented growth bound.
Run the same render and schema gate locally with:

```sh
make deploy-validate

# Temporal values render (pinned chart version — see temporal/values.yaml header):
helm repo add temporal https://go.temporal.io/helm-charts
helm template temporal temporal/temporal --version 0.62.0 \
  --namespace goobers-temporal -f deploy/reference/temporal/values.yaml >/dev/null
```

For consumer overlay pins and actual image contents, add `--overlay-dir` and
the image requirements described in [overlay/image preflight](../../docs/guides/overlay-image-preflight.md).
These checks are explicitly unchecked when the overlay is omitted.

`goobers doctor --k8s` (deliverable K3, issue #668) is the companion preflight: it
verifies a target cluster against the same shape-doc requirements these manifests express.

## Stamping a new gaggle

Copy one of `gaggle-namespace/examples/*`, set `namespace:` to the gaggle's namespace
name and the `goobers.dev/gaggle` label pair, then replace the CHANGE-ME
workload-identity annotation for that gaggle (§3: one namespace and one federated
identity per gaggle; GAG-012, SEC-001/002). Stage egress grants are per runner class:
render them with `goobers netpol-render --out <dir>` (filled from `instance.yaml
egress.allowlist`) and apply them alongside the base — the base itself carries only
the class-independent floor (default-deny-all + allow-dns).

The base also ships `dispatcher-rbac.yaml`, binding the **existing** `goobers-worker`
ServiceAccount (`goobers-system/worker-rbac.yaml`) — not a new identity — to create,
get, delete and list pods in this gaggle's namespace, and read the worker's own
Deployment (DI-9 template read). This is what lets a worker actually dispatch
pod-per-stage runs into a gaggle namespace (#4286); stage pods themselves still get
no token mount and no RBAC grants at all. The included `goobers-stage` ServiceAccount
is still a target-topology template, not one the current dispatcher selects — every
stage pod runs under its namespace's default ServiceAccount (workload identity
federation, `spec.isolation.identityRef`, is tracked separately from #4897). As of
#4897, `--dispatch-namespace` no longer names a pod namespace at all — it is only
the non-empty flag that enables mode-3 dispatch. The worker instead routes EACH
stage pod to its OWNING gaggle's `spec.isolation.namespace`, resolved per attempt
from the config it already loads; there is no worker-wide fallback. A worker
that polls more than one gaggle's queues therefore needs this base applied once
per gaggle namespace (see `examples/gaggle-a` and `examples/gaggle-b`) — its
boot-time preflight checks every declared namespace's existence and this
worker's RBAC access to it before polling or dispatching anything, and refuses
to start, naming the gap, if one is missing or under-provisioned. Two gaggles
may still explicitly declare the SAME namespace; that shared topology is
supported and unaffected by this routing.

## Operating notes from a real cluster

Everything below was hit while standing up these shapes on AKS end to end
(Goobernetes spike, epic #2889): a Linux daemon, a Windows worker, Temporal with
CloudNativePG, and a workflow that merged a pull request across both operating
systems. They are recorded because each one cost real time to diagnose and none
of them are guessable from the manifests.

### Mixed-OS clusters: pin every workload, taint the Windows nodes

**AKS does not taint Windows nodes.** `kubectl get node <win> -o jsonpath='{.spec.taints}'`
returns empty, so nothing stops a Linux pod from being scheduled onto one.

That is not a scheduling inconvenience, it is **data loss**. A Linux pod with no
`nodeSelector` landed on a Windows node, Windows initialized the attached managed
disk, and an MBR partition table was written over the ext4 superblock — the volume
was not corrupted, it was replaced (#2883). It survives a pod restart perfectly;
it does not survive a scheduling accident.

Two defences, and you want both:

```sh
kubectl taint node <windows-node> kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule
```

`NoSchedule` does not evict running pods, so it is safe to apply to a live
cluster. Give Windows workloads the matching toleration, and pin every Linux
workload with `nodeSelector: {kubernetes.io/os: linux}` — including anything a
CRD schedules for you. CloudNativePG takes it under `spec.affinity.nodeSelector`,
not the pod template, which is easy to miss.

The failure is also **misreported**. The visible error is
`401 Unauthorized` from the registry, because the Windows containerd snapshotter
fails to unpack a Linux image and the client falls back to an anonymous token
request. Ignore the 401 and look for `io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.windows` in the
message.

### Storage: keep the instance root on RWO and artifacts on RWX

`goobers doctor --k8s` warns when it finds an RWX-capable class because
provisioner-name inference cannot prove cross-client coordination safety. On
Azure Files, EFS, Filestore, CephFS and NFS, POSIX `flock` does not exclude
across clients and SQLite WAL is documented-unsafe — and the instance root
carries both file locks and SQLite databases (#2854). Put the **instance root
and journal** on a ReadWriteOnce block volume mounted by a single node.

The **artifact store** is the opposite case: put it on a ReadWriteMany volume.
It is safe on exactly those network storage classes because a content-addressed
store never locks: a digest is written once, published by rename, and two
writers racing on one digest are writing identical bytes.

### Secrets

The Secrets Store CSI driver mounts secrets `0644` by design. Goobers accepts
those mode bits only when `internal/platform/secfile` can prove that the file is
on a read-only tmpfs, as Kubernetes uses for pod-private CSI and Secret-volume
mounts. Everywhere else, token files remain owner-only and the check fails
closed if the mount protection cannot be established. For providers that do not
expose a read-only tmpfs, use an initContainer to copy and chmod the secret into
a memory-backed `emptyDir`.

On Windows the same control is expressed through ACLs rather than mode bits, and
a copied file inherits a grant to `S-1-5-11` (Authenticated Users). Break
inheritance: `icacls <file> /inheritance:r /grant:r '<principal>:F'`.

### Egress allowlist: name hosts, not domain suffixes

This is the **HTTP proxy's** host allowlist (the `egress-allowlist` ConfigMap a
Squid or equivalent forward proxy reads), not `instance.yaml`'s `egress.allowlist`,
which is CIDR groups rendered into NetworkPolicies by `goobers netpol-render`. A
CIDR cannot separate two hosts behind one vendor's shared front end; only the
proxy sees the hostname, so the choice below can only be made here.

An agentic stage's egress allowlist exists to admit **the model endpoint**. A
domain-suffix entry does more than that: the vendors that serve the model API
also serve their CLI's own analytics and crash-reporting hosts from siblings
under the same suffix, so one entry written as `.<vendor>.com` — with a comment
saying "the model endpoint" — silently admits the harness's telemetry too.

This is not hypothetical. On a live instance, 96h of the egress proxy's access
log carried 119,094 tunneled `CONNECT`s with **zero** `TCP_DENIED`: 19 to the
vendor's API host and 3 to its telemetry host, both riding the same
suffix entry (#4276). Nothing was misconfigured and nothing was blocked — that
is precisely the problem: the allowlist could not express the difference, so no
one ever made the choice.

Write the entry as the exact API host instead (the repo/backlog provider, OIDC,
and registry hosts your instance reaches are separate entries alongside it —
this snippet shows only the model-endpoint line the suffix trap lives on):

```
# egress-allowlist ConfigMap (see the subPath note below for how to mount it)
#
# Model endpoint for the harness this instance actually runs — one exact host,
# not a suffix. The image ships the Copilot CLI as the default harness; a
# Claude Code harness uses the Anthropic host instead. List only what you run.
api.githubcopilot.com
#api.anthropic.com
#
# Each vendor CLI's own analytics/crash-reporting hosts are siblings under the
# SAME domain suffix and are deliberately NOT listed. A suffix entry
# (.githubcopilot.com, .anthropic.com) admits them silently and reads, in the
# manifest, exactly like the line above. Admit one only by writing its exact
# hostname here, as a deliberate, reviewable line.
```

`SEC-048` ("no phone-home") does **not** cover this: its guard parses this
repository's own Go/JS/TS call sites and cannot see a third-party harness
subprocess's egress at all (`docs/requirements/security.md`, SEC-048's scope
paragraph). Vendor-subprocess telemetry is an operator decision, and this
allowlist is where the operator makes it.

Derive the exact host set from evidence, not from a vendor doc page: run the
harness through the proxy with the API host allowlisted and read the denials out
of the proxy's own log. A denial names the host it blocked; a suffix entry never
tells you what it let through.

### `subPath` ConfigMap mounts never receive updates

A `subPath` volumeMount looks identical to a whole-file or whole-directory mount
in the manifest — same `configMap` ref, same `mountPath` — but its update
behavior is not. Kubernetes materializes a `subPath` target as a **copy** made
once at pod creation, not the symlinked, periodically-resynced view a
whole-ConfigMap mount gets. Editing the ConfigMap afterwards changes nothing in
the running container until the pod restarts, and nothing at write time warns
about it: the manifest is indistinguishable from a hot-reloadable one (#3365).

This bit a live instance running a Squid egress proxy: the allowlist ConfigMap
was mounted with `subPath` for a single-file target, an allowlist fix (adding an
entry the proxy needed) landed in the ConfigMap, and Squid kept enforcing the
stale rule until the pod was restarted — dropping in-flight agentic HTTP. The
same trap applies to `goobers up --watch-config` or any other config-driven
sidecar: the daemon's own reloader polls its config directory for a changed
digest every second (`configReloadInterval`, `cmd/goobers/configreload.go`), but
a second's cadence buys nothing if the bytes underneath a `subPath` mount never
change — the loop ticks forever and finds nothing to reload.

Avoid it by mounting the **whole ConfigMap (or a projected volume combining
several) at its own directory, without `subPath`**, and pointing the app at that
directory instead of a single carved-out file:

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: allowlist
    mountPath: /etc/squid/allow.d   # whole directory, no subPath
volumes:
  - name: allowlist
    configMap:
      name: egress-allowlist
```

The kubelet resyncs a whole-ConfigMap mount by atomically swapping a symlink, so
`squid -k reconfigure` (or any watcher polling the directory) sees the new
content without a restart. When the application truly needs one fixed file path
and can't take a directory, an initContainer that copies the ConfigMap entry into
an `emptyDir` at startup also works — it adds a moving part, but keeps
whole-mount update semantics on the source you actually edit.

Either way, verify by execution, not by reading the manifest: edit the
ConfigMap, wait past the resync/reload interval, and confirm the running process
(or the mounted file's content — `kubectl exec … -- cat <path>`) actually
changed. The manifest that broke reload here read exactly like a working one.

### The worker reloads its own config tree

`goobers worker --instance <root>` re-reads `<root>/config` every
`--config-reload-interval` (default 10s, `0` disables) and atomically replaces
the gaggle, credential, and agentic-kit seams whose config changed, so a
definitions edit reaches the **next** stage that worker serves without a pod
restart (#3912). It is the same content-digest reload the daemon runs
(`configDirectoryDigest`), including the read-validate-reread stability check
that keeps a half-written tree from ever becoming the tree in force.

The properties worth knowing when operating it:

- **An in-flight attempt keeps the kit it was handed.** Seams are replaced by
  publishing a new immutable snapshot, never by mutating a live one, so a
  reload landing mid-stage cannot change that stage's instructions or
  credentials underneath it. Attempt *N+1* gets the new tree.
- **Only the gaggles whose inputs changed are rebuilt.** An untouched gaggle's
  seams are carried across the reload by pointer — no repeated harness
  preflight, no re-resolved credentials.
- **A tree that does not parse is rejected, loudly, and changes nothing.** The
  worker logs the named failure once (and again only if the failure changes),
  keeps serving its last-known-good tree, and applies the repair when it lands.
  It never silently falls back to a partially-loaded tree.

This closes the product-side half of Infra LEDGER **I-51**, where a worker sat
one Workflows revision behind the daemon for 32 minutes and every stage it
served resolved credentials against the stale gaggle. What it does **not** do is
make bytes appear under a mount that never updates: a `config/` directory
copied once into an `emptyDir` by an initContainer is frozen for the life of the
pod, and the reloader will poll it forever finding nothing — exactly the
`subPath` trap above, in a different costume. Give the worker a config tree that
actually changes (a projected volume, a synced PVC, a sidecar
that writes into the mounted directory), then verify by execution: edit the
tree, wait past the interval, and confirm the worker logged
`worker config reload: applied config tree sha256:…`.

For credential-free cross-node **boot seeding**, use the
[rendered-config mirror overlay](config-mirror/README.md) instead of a worker
ConfigMap bridge. It copies a complete validated snapshot without the ConfigMap
size ceiling. It is deliberately not a live updater: drain and recreate workers
to consume a newer seed, accounting for configuration pins of in-flight runs.

### The worker refuses a kit its run was not admitted against

Reload alone is not a pin: it removes the stale window, but on its own a reload
landing between two attempts of the same run would hand attempt *N+1* a
different curator than attempt *N*. #3884 closes that. Every stage envelope an
engine run dispatches carries the run's `gooberDigest`, and the worker serves
the config tree whose goober digest **equals** that pin, or serves nothing.

- **A pin the worker cannot serve is refused, by name.** The attempt fails with
  `gate_pin_missing` (no held tree matches) or `run_pin_unverifiable` (no tree
  could be compiled into a digest at all, so a match cannot be proven either
  way). The message names the gaggle, workflow, expected digest and the digests
  the worker can serve — **digests only**, never instructions, skills or
  credentials, so it is safe in any log an operator reads.
- **The refusal is retriable.** It is classified as an infrastructure failure,
  so it spends the run's infrastructure-retry budget, not its policy budget.
  Roll the worker's config tree forward, let the reload apply, and the next
  retry resolves the pin and proceeds. That is the intended repair, and it is
  the reason the refusal is not fatal.
- **Recently superseded trees are retained, within a bound.** The worker keeps
  up to `--config-history-depth` (default 3, `0` disables) superseded snapshots,
  newest first, so a reload can *add* a satisfiable digest without *removing*
  one an in-flight run still needs. Snapshots are self-contained: instructions
  and skill packages are captured when the tree is read, never re-read from
  disk later, because a retained snapshot that went back to disk would resolve
  the current tree while claiming to be the old one.
- **Past the bound it fails closed, and a restart holds nothing.** Evicted trees
  refuse with `gate_pin_missing`; a restarted worker has no history at all and
  refuses every stale pin. Retention keeps in-flight runs alive across a reload;
  it is never a correctness guarantee a run may lean on.
- **Deterministic stages stay unpinned.** `gooberDigest` is goober-kit identity
  — instructions, skills, model, harness, MCP, tools — and a deterministic stage
  executes none of it. It runs on the current tree, which is what the reload
  above is for.

Set the bound to match how long your stages actually take:
`--config-history-depth 0` if you want every superseded pin to refuse
immediately, higher if you routinely roll config forward while multi-hour runs
are in flight. Each retained tree costs one snapshot's worth of instructions and
skill files in memory, so keep it small.

### Images

The default image carries the Copilot CLI agent harness. Its home is mounted from
an `emptyDir` in the reference worker so `$HOME/.copilot` remains writable while
the container root filesystem stays read-only. To use another harness, derive an
image that installs it and set the matching `runner.harnessCommand` in
`instance.yaml`; the map is keyed by harness name. Copilot wrappers must implement
the [explicit launcher session contract](../../docs/guides/harness-launcher-contract.md)
and pass admission/preflight; simple argument forwarding is not sufficient.

Budget for the Windows image: roughly **2.4 GB**, and about **4m30s** for a cold
pull on a fresh node. If your operator-selected capacity policy scales the Windows
pool to zero, expect that pull on the first run after it scales up.

### Container init: who reaps orphaned stage descendants

The image is `ENTRYPOINT ["goobers"]` in exec form with no init wrapper, so the
daemon is **pid 1** of its container. That makes it the kernel's reparent target
for every stage descendant that outlives its parent — a double-fork, or a
descendant whose parent `KillTree` reaches first — and a Go program waits for
nothing but its own `exec.Cmd` children. Nobody else is above it to reap.

The daemon supplies that missing init half itself: at startup it checks
`os.Getpid() == 1` on Linux and, only then, runs a SIGCHLD-driven loop that
`wait4`s orphaned descendants (#3398). It logs
`startup: running as container init (pid 1)` when it does. The loop deliberately
waits specific pids rather than `wait4(-1)`, so it never consumes a stage's exit
status out from under the runner. Nothing is needed in the pod spec for the
reference deployments.

Two arrangements put the daemon somewhere other than pid 1 and switch the loop
off; give those a reaping init instead:

- Wrapping the entrypoint in a shell (`sh -c "goobers up …"`) — the shell
  becomes pid 1 and most shells do not reap. Prefer exec form, or `exec goobers`.
- Sidecar or debug containers sharing a pid namespace
  (`shareProcessNamespace: true`), where the pause container is pid 1.

The general escape hatch is any minimal init as pid 1 — `tini -g`, the
`--init` flag for plain `docker run`, or `shareProcessNamespace: true` so the
pause container reaps. Symptom when nobody does: `Z`-state processes
accumulating in the pod and worktrees never released.

### Timezones

Windows containers ship no IANA database. `goobers` embeds Go's copy, so a
location name works — but any other Windows tooling in your image will not have
it.

### Multi-worker runs need the artifact store

A stage consumes prior work through ContextPointers, which resolve as a path on
the **local** filesystem. One worker: correct and free. Two workers: stage 2 is
polled by a node whose staging area is empty and fails closed on an integrity
fault. `--blob-store` on a ReadWriteMany volume is what makes a run spannable;
omit it (and the volume) if you run exactly one worker.

Code state is a separate channel and is **not** shared: every stage attempt gets
a fresh worktree on the run branch, so what survives between stages is the branch
in that worker's own git mirror. A stage that hands work to another platform must
push first (#2861).

The `goobers-system` namespace enforces Pod Security Standards `restricted`.
PSS evaluates **initContainers** too, so an adopter's per-worker instance-root
seed must set the same non-root, no-escalation, dropped-capabilities, read-only
root filesystem, and `RuntimeDefault` seccomp controls as the application
container. The reference worker includes that restricted-compatible seed.
These controls are Linux-only: Kubernetes rejects them on Windows pods. Keep
Linux and Windows workers as separate Deployments, set `spec.os.name: windows`
for Windows workers, and do not copy the Linux security context into them.

### Cluster rebuilds

`az aks get-credentials --overwrite-existing` does not reliably repoint `kubectl`
after a cluster is deleted and recreated under the same name — it can keep
resolving the old control-plane FQDN and fail with `no such host`. Re-run it
explicitly as a step rather than trusting the flag.

### Worker replacement and shutdown

The Linux reference worker uses `Recreate` because its instance root holds locks
on an RWO volume: the old pod must exit before its replacement starts. This
introduces a brief polling interruption during upgrades; Temporal retains queued
work. Keep this worker at one replica until instance storage is separated for
additional workers. Both worker templates allow 90 seconds for shutdown, covering
the default 30-second Temporal drain, up to 30 seconds of stage-pod cleanup, and
process exit. Increase the pod grace period when increasing `--drain-timeout`.
The Linux worker also mounts a bounded, pod-private `/tmp` so config snapshots
and git helpers can write temporary files under a read-only root filesystem.

### Scoped cloud preflight checks

`goobers doctor --k8s --checks apiserver-ipblock-drift` runs only the
API-server drift check. Unknown, empty, or repeated check selections are usage
errors. Omitting `--checks` runs the full preflight. This lets the recurring
monitor retain its NetworkPolicy-only RBAC instead of acquiring the install,
node, storage, and pod permissions that the full report requires.

Mark **dedicated API-server egress policies** with
`goobers.dev/apiserver-egress: "true"`. The checker inspects their egress
`ipBlock` entries against the configured comparison endpoint (the kubeconfig server by default);
ordinary provider allowlists and ingress client CIDRs are excluded. Use an
exact `/32` (IPv4) or `/128` (IPv6), and do not exclude the endpoint with an
`except` entry. The example monitor includes a policy for its own API egress;
replace its documentation IP with the control-plane IP and set the CronJob's
`--apiserver-endpoint` to its matching DNS URL. In-cluster client configuration
normally names the Kubernetes Service ClusterIP; it may differ from the
control-plane address the CNI evaluates after destination NAT. The comparison
override does not change the monitor's authenticated client connection. The
namespace's DNS grant must also be present. Inspecting zero marked egress
entries fails with a checked-zero diagnostic. Migration from older overlays
requires adding the purpose label to their API egress policies.

`runner-class-capacity` checks each active runner pod against one compatible
node, including its node selector, required node affinity, hard taints,
resource requests, init-container peak, restartable init sidecars, and pod
overhead. Several replicas of a class do not become one giant pod, and CPU on
one node cannot satisfy a pod whose memory fits only on another node. This is
static request fit, not current free capacity or a complete scheduler verdict:
inter-pod placement, volume constraints, and dynamic allocation still need
scheduler observation. No active runner pods means unverified, not success.

The current `otlp-signal-set` implementation is **not release evidence of
telemetry ingestion**. Its endpoint option is not connected to the CLI, and
its library probe issues HTTP GET requests, whereas OTLP/HTTP ingestion uses
POST. Do not count a skipped check or a generic HTTP success as proof that
traces, metrics, and logs were received; capture actual collector/backend
observations for the smoke until a protocol-correct check is wired.
