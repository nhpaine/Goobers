# Contributing to Goobers

Thanks for your interest in Goobers — an open, self-hosted agent-workforce platform.
This guide covers the GitHub-based contribution flow. For what the project is and where
it's going, start with [`README.md`](README.md), [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md),
and [`docs/VISION.md`](docs/VISION.md).

## Development setup

All development requires the Go toolchain declared in [`go.mod`](go.mod)
(currently Go 1.26.6), Git, and
[`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run) `v2.12.2` (schema-v2 config in
[`.golangci.yml`](.golangci.yml)). Node.js 24 with npm is required only for
Portal work, complete dashboard-enabled binaries, and the merge/full validation
tiers; ordinary Go builds, tests, vet, and `make verify-fast` remain Node-free.

```sh
make verify-fast # pre-push format, vet, and Go build tier
make tidy-check  # check that go.mod/go.sum match tidy output
make ci          # merge gate: full Go, config, and portal validation
make verify-full # ci plus integration, platform, and coverage gates
make vulncheck   # scan reachable Go code for known vulnerabilities
```

### Validation tier contract

The stable local contract is `make verify-fast` ⊂ `make ci` ⊂
`make verify-full`:

| Tier | Composition | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `make verify-fast` | Format check, `go vet`, and every `cmd/*` Go build | Fast feedback during development and before a push |
| `make ci` | The portable merge gate: fast-tier checks plus module tidiness, flake-policy enforcement, the cyclomatic-complexity baseline gate, shipped-config validation, race tests with coverage, lint, and portal build/test/contract checks | Required before merge; the shipped agent workflows' `local-ci` stages invoke this tier |
| `make verify-full` | `ci` plus strict declared-dependency integration tests, walking-skeleton e2e, journal conformance, Kubernetes envtest, coverage threshold, native sandbox confinement, and Linux-node/Windows-seam validation | Nightly, on-demand, and release-candidate validation |

`make vulncheck` is a separate, network-backed static-analysis gate. It runs the
pinned `govulncheck` version used by pull-request and scheduled CI without adding
network access to the hermetic merge-tier test process.
`make tidy-check` reproduces the merge tier's `go mod tidy -diff` check with the
same configured Go command and inherited module settings.

The subset relationship is executable rather than documentary:
`verify-fast` selects checks from the same Go check list as `ci`, while
`verify-full` asks the same orchestrator to invoke `ci` and each additional
Make gate serially. Tests in `test/ci` compare the complete tier check lists and
recipes, so extra or missing commands fail the contract check. Each validation
tier prints the elapsed time for every gate it runs; CI also publishes
structured unit-test timing and soft-budget comparisons — see
[`docs/guides/test-timing.md`](docs/guides/test-timing.md).

The fast tier compiles `cmd/goobers` without the generated Portal artifact so
ordinary Go feedback stays Node-free. The merge tier builds the lockfile-pinned
artifact and compiles the complete binary with the `embed_portal` build tag.
The stress tier's fingerprint ledger, expiring quarantine helper, and
no-anonymous-retry rule are documented in
[`docs/guides/flake-management.md`](docs/guides/flake-management.md).

Tests that intentionally execute tools outside the Go test process belong in
`//go:build integration` files and must declare each executable with
`testdep.Require`; their names use the `TestIntegration*` prefix so the tier
runs no ordinary package tests. `make test-integration` is the
developer-friendly entrypoint: a missing tool produces a visible, uniform skip
with an install hint.
`make test-integration-strict` sets `TESTDEP_STRICT=1`, so the same absence is a
test failure; `verify-full` and CI always use this strict target. The integration
runner prints the dependency inventory, runs only packages containing tagged
tests, and rejects direct `exec.LookPath`, raw skips, or inventory drift.
Ordinary unit tests should use in-process fakes; integration tests are for real
local executables, not network services, cloud credentials, or heavyweight
infrastructure.

### Design-document status and lifecycle metadata

Every Markdown document under `docs/design/` and `docs/adr/` must put a
`Status:` marker in its first 40 lines. The first word after the marker is one
of this controlled enum:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Proposed, exploratory, or under review |
| `approved` | Accepted as a design or decision, but not necessarily implemented |
| `implemented` | Reflected in the shipped system |
| `superseded` | Replaced in whole or in part by a newer source of record |
| `historical` | Retained as a completed campaign, survey, or other historical record |

Status values are case-insensitive, and free-text detail may follow the enum
value — `> Status: **implemented — GA in #1939**`.

**The enum alone was not enough.** A word anyone can type is not evidence, and
the 2026-09-06 documentation audit found fully shipped designs still marked
`draft`, partial implementations marked `implemented`, and superseding designs
that never marked the records they replaced — all while the gate passed. So the
status now travels with metadata, written as `Key: value` lines beside it in the
same header block (#4518):

```markdown
# Design: something

> Status: **implemented** — landed across the CONF wave
> Delivered-by: #2074, #2075, #2076
> Supersedes: docs/design/older-thing.md
> Verified: 09db115bb (2026-09-06)
```

| Key | When it is required |
|---|---|
| `Delivered-by:` | **Required for `implemented`.** Name the issues or PRs that delivered it. A partial delivery is recorded by listing what *did* land and keeping an honest status (`approved`), not by claiming `implemented`. |
| `Superseded-by:` | **Required for `superseded`.** Names the document that replaced it — a repo-relative `docs/…` path, which may be a requirements spec, not only another design. |
| `Supersedes:` | Required *reciprocally*: if A declares `Superseded-by: B` and B is a design/ADR page, B must declare `Supersedes: A`, and vice versa. A one-sided supersession leaves a reader with no forward pointer, which is how a newer Windows design came to be written against an obsolete shape. |
| `Verified:` | Optional until a delivery-closing PR refreshes it. Use a 7–40 character hexadecimal commit revision and a valid calendar date: `09db115bb (2026-09-06)`. This records when claims were checked; it does not itself prove them true. |
| `Area:` | Optional. |
| `Owner:` | Optional accountable maintainer or team; displayed with `Area` in the index. |
| `Tracking:` | Explicit issue references for the complete design work package, distinct from what has already landed. |
| `Pending-delivery:` | Issue references for unfinished obligations within the design's scope. Requires `Scope-delta`; incompatible with `implemented`. Do not reuse an issue in both this field and `Delivered-by`. |
| `Scope-delta:` | Explains the designed behavior that has not shipped, or an intentional scope change. Required when `Pending-delivery` is present. |

For a partial delivery, use explicit metadata such as:

```markdown
> Status: approved
> Owner: @maintainer
> Tracking: #100
> Delivered-by: #101
> Pending-delivery: #102
> Scope-delta: Local execution ships; remote recovery remains unimplemented.
```

The scheduled check resolves tracking, delivered, and pending references together.
An issue's closed state is resolved from GitHub; a PR reference additionally
requires that the PR merged, not merely that it was closed without delivery.
Open pending work keeps the partial status honest even when all delivered work is
closed. Closed pending references are stale and must move into the delivery ledger
with an updated scope delta. An unresolved reference is an error, never evidence
that the design finished. Historical prose headed `Remaining` is not this field:
such notes sometimes describe optional extensions outside the completed design.

Two further rules the same check enforces:

- **`docs/design/README.md` is generated.** It indexes every design and ADR with
  this metadata. Regenerate it with `make docs` (or `go run ./test/designstatus
  -write`); the merge gate fails if it is stale, so a new design cannot be added
  without appearing in the index.
- **`docs/guides/README.md` is generated.** It indexes every guide by its
  level-one title. Regenerate it with `make docs` (or `go run
  ./test/markdownlinks -write`); the markdown-links merge check rejects index
  drift and any guide unreachable from that index, `docs/cli`, or `docs/man`.
- **A citation into somebody's home directory must say it is unreachable.** A
  path like `~/source/Reviews/finding.md` cannot be resolved by any other
  reader, so a document containing one must also contain the phrase *"not
  reproducible from this repository"*. Committing the artifact or citing a
  stable URL is better; the disclaimer is the floor. Product paths that name the
  same location on every machine — `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, a Windows
  container's `C:\Users\ContainerUser\…` — are not citations and are not
  flagged.

**When a change closes a design's work item, update that design in the same
PR.** Add the issue to its `Delivered-by:` ledger, move the status if the
program is complete, and record any scope delta — what was designed and did not
ship — rather than leaving the design readable as a specification of behaviour
that does not exist. A scheduled, non-blocking check
(`design-ledger-reconcile.yml`) reports both directions of drift: an
`implemented` page whose delivery issues are still open, and a `draft`/`approved`
page whose entire ledger has closed.

The same scheduled workflow checks the actual dormant-workflow inventory against
GitHub. It reports unresolvable or untracked blockers and dormant workflows whose
referenced blocking issues are all closed. These are review findings, not permission
to enable or retire a workflow automatically.

The PR checks job obtains GitHub's `closingIssuesReferences` (not a heuristic
scan of PR prose) and compares the proposed design metadata with the pinned base
revision. For a closing issue associated through `Tracking`, `Pending-delivery`,
or the legacy `Delivered-by` ledger, the PR must retain the design, add the issue
to `Delivered-by`, remove it from `Pending-delivery`, provide a `Scope-delta`
(including an explicit no-delta statement when appropriate), and refresh
`Verified`. Removing a tracking reference cannot bypass the base-tree check.
Use `Tracking` when assigning a new design work item so this association is
explicit. PR edits trigger CI too, because editing closing references changes
the delivery claim without changing the code revision.

For local reproduction, pass `-delivery-context <file>` to
`go run ./test/designstatus` (or set `GOOBERS_DESIGN_DELIVERY_CONTEXT` for
`make ci`). The JSON object contains a full `baseRevision` commit SHA and an
explicit `closingIssues` array of local `#123` references. The base commit must
be available locally. Missing, malformed, or truncated CI context fails closed;
an explicitly empty closing-issue array needs no delivery update.

**Humans:** use `verify-fast` for the short edit/push loop, `ci` for the merge
gate, and `verify-full` on a Unix-like host with the pinned envtest and native
sandbox prerequisites available. **Agent workflow authors:** a Goobers
`local-ci` stage for this repository must call `make ci`; the subprocess may
assume only the tools listed below are on the daemon's `PATH` and otherwise
inherits the daemon environment. This contract does not make stage execution
hermetic. For another repository, configure its real non-interactive merge-gate
command instead. **CI:** each validation job maps to the same contract:

<!-- ci-required-jobs:start -->

| GitHub Actions job | Tier correspondence |
|---|---|
| `preflight (lint · format · policy · vet · build)` | Fast source, policy, vet, build, and configuration admission gate |
| `dead-code analysis` | Reachability checks for Go and portal production code |
| `checks` | Portal, canvas-extension, generated-contract, and manifest slice of `make ci` |
| `deploy reference manifests` | Render and schema validation for the shipped reference deployment |
| `lint (${{ matrix.goos }})` | `golangci-lint` across Linux, macOS, and Windows |
| `darwin gate (build · vet)` | The macOS build + `go vet` slice of `verify-fast` |
| `windows gate (build · vet · runtime smoke)` | The Windows `go vet` + build slice of `verify-fast`, plus a runtime smoke |
| `Go vulnerability scan` | Standalone `make vulncheck` gate for reachable standard-library and dependency vulnerabilities |
| `unit race shard ${{ matrix.shard }} (linux)` | Hermetic whole-tree unit suite split into Linux race shards |
| `unit coverage gate (linux)` | Whole-tree Go coverage profile and threshold gate, plus the per-test timing ledger |
| `macOS runtime (unit · shipped · sandbox)` | Whole-tree behavioural suite and shipped-workflow contracts, plus required native Seatbelt confinement on PRs, consolidated onto one macOS allocation |
| `shipped workflow contracts (${{ matrix.os }})` | Shipped workflow contract suite on Linux and Windows; the macOS leg is consolidated above |
| `declared-dependency integration` | Full-tier `make test-integration-strict` gate with every inventoried executable provisioned, plus the envtest control-plane gate (`KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS`) |
| `sandbox confinement (ubuntu-latest)` | Full-tier `make sandbox-check` gate with native bubblewrap availability required; macOS Seatbelt is consolidated above |
| `linux node validation (#636/#639)` | Full-tier `make linux-node-validation` platform acceptance gate for the shipped binary, daemon lifecycle, and Windows seams |
| `make ci (fmt-check · vet · build · test · lint)` | Required aggregate status for all rows above; it runs no additional validation |

<!-- ci-required-jobs:end -->

The dedicated vulnerability, integration, sandbox, and Linux-node CI jobs invoke
their corresponding Make targets. The vulnerability target also runs daily from
`.github/workflows/vulnerability-scan.yml`, so newly disclosed findings surface
without a code change.

#### macOS allocation benchmark

The behavioral, shipped-workflow, and Seatbelt gates share the `unit-macos`
allocation. This preserves three separately named steps; each later step is
guarded with `!cancelled()` so a failed earlier command does not suppress the
remaining coverage. The macOS build and lint jobs remain separate because they
cover different responsibilities.

The following sample was collected from ten successful pull-request `ci.yml`
runs before and after the consolidation on 2026-09-21. Queue is
`run_started_at - created_at`; wall-clock is `updated_at - created_at`; and
runner-minutes is the sum of the behavioral, shipped-contract, and sandbox job
durations only (the unrelated macOS build and lint jobs are excluded). Run IDs
are included so the measurements are reproducible from GitHub Actions.

| sample | queue (min) | wall-clock (min) | macOS gate runner-minutes | CI run |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| before 1 | 0.0 | 23.4 | 23.8 | 34653973504 |
| before 2 | 0.0 | 24.0 | 18.1 | 34650766361 |

| after 10 | 0.0 | 36.5 | 22.6 | 35550807780 |

The medians are 0.0/27.6/19.0 before and 0.0/29.4/22.9 after
(queue/wall-clock/runner-minutes). Wall-clock increased 6.5%, below the
10% material-regression threshold used for this decision, while the required
macOS allocation count fell from three to one. The consolidation is therefore
retained: it removes two scarce runner allocations without dropping any
behavioral, workflow-contract, or sandbox command.

`make test-conformance`, `make test-e2e`, `make test-envtest` and
`make cover-check` remain as local and full-tier targets, but **no longer have
dedicated CI jobs.** Each was an unsharded whole-tree run of a suite another
required job already runs, and together they cost ~48 of the ~142 runner-minutes
a pull request consumed and set both ends of its critical path. What each one
uniquely enforced moved rather than lapsed:

- **coverage** → the `make cover-gate` step on `unit-linux-coverage`, which runs
  the suite unsharded and so emits the whole-tree profile the gate needs.
- **envtest** → `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` provisioning on `integration`, which already
  selects `internal/operator` and already enforces the `-run=^TestIntegration`
  contract through a runtime AST scan. That job now asserts
  `TestIntegrationEnvtestReconcile` actually PASSED, because `testdep.RequireEnv`
  SKIPS it when the variable is empty — a shape that previously let the job exit
  0 without exercising an API server at all.
- **conformance** and **e2e** → already ran, unfiltered, inside the `unit` shards.
  `-run` filters execution but not compilation, so the conformance job was
  rebuilding 147 race-instrumented binaries to run 32 tests. The shard invocation
  carries `-count=1`, which was that job's only genuine differentiator.

`make test-conformance` still selects every Go test whose name begins with
`TestConformance`, currently covering `journal.ConformanceView`, journal sequence
determinism, and the local-runner walking-skeleton seed. That target and naming
boundary remain the landing zone for the V2 local-to-Temporal dual-runner
conformance harness. Future stress jobs follow the same
one-target-per-job pattern.
Focused targets such as
`make validate-configs`, `make portal-ci`, and `make portal-contract` remain
available when only one surface changed. `go run ./test/ci` is the
cross-platform implementation of `make ci`; it launches tools without Bash or
POSIX-shell syntax. On Windows, stock `cmd.exe` is used only for Node's
`npm.cmd` shim, and GNU Make is not required. Other convenience targets can
still use a POSIX shell.

Micro-benchmarks for journal event encoding, scrubbing, parsing, and read-model
projection are opt-in and do not run with ordinary tests:

```sh
go test -run=^$ -bench=. ./internal/journal ./internal/readmodel
```

### Platform prerequisites

Tools can also acquire binaries and artifacts lazily. Before using an
egress-controlled runner, consult the [runtime acquisition manifest and local
override guide](docs/guides/runtime-acquisition.md). The preflight gate checks
discovered acquisition sites against that inventory; cached executables alone do
not make the complete merge tier offline-capable.

| Platform | Required tools | Merge-tier invocation |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Go from `go.mod`, Node.js 24 with npm, Git, `golangci-lint` v2.12.2 | `go run ./test/ci` (`make ci` also works with GNU Make and a POSIX shell) |
| macOS | Go from `go.mod`, Node.js 24 with npm, Git, `golangci-lint` v2.12.2 | `go run ./test/ci` (`make ci` also works with GNU Make and a POSIX shell) |
| Windows | Go from `go.mod`, Node.js 24 with npm, Git for Windows, `golangci-lint` v2.12.2, 64-bit MinGW-w64 GCC | `go run ./test/ci` from PowerShell or Command Prompt; Bash and GNU Make are not required |

The Windows compiler is required by Go's race detector, not by the CI task
runner. Install a 64-bit MinGW-w64 GCC with runtime version 8 or newer, put its
`bin` directory on `PATH`, and set `CC` when the compiler executable is not
named `gcc`. The portable runner sets `CGO_ENABLED=1` for the race-test step.
Verify the runtime with `gcc --print-file-name libsynchronization.a`: a
compatible installation prints the full path to that library rather than the
bare filename. See Go's
[race-detector requirements](https://go.dev/doc/articles/race_detector#Requirements).
No Bash or MSYS shell is required by the gate; tests that specifically
exercise Unix process and shell semantics are platform-gated on Windows.
`verify-full` is Unix-hosted because its envtest, native-sandbox, and node
validation targets use POSIX host facilities; Linux additionally requires
`bubblewrap` with unprivileged user namespaces available.
The strict integration target additionally provisions the executable inventory
reported by `make test-integration`; when adding a dependency, update
`test/testsupport/testdep` and the integration CI provisioning step together.

### CI platform matrix

| Runner | Command | PR status | What it gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ubuntu-latest` | `go run ./test/ci` | Required via the aggregate CI check | The full Linux Go and portal gate |
| `macos-latest` | `go run ./test/ci` | Required via the aggregate CI check | The full macOS Go and portal gate |
| `windows-latest` | `go build ./...` + `go vet ./...` | Required via the aggregate CI check | Native Windows compile and vet coverage |
| `ubuntu-latest` | `make vulncheck` | Required via the aggregate CI check | Reachable Go vulnerability findings |

The required `make ci (fmt-check · vet · build · test · lint)` status keeps its
existing name for branch-protection compatibility and fails when either full
platform leg, the Windows compile slice, or the vulnerability scan fails. Go
module and build caches are scoped to each runner OS.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repo (external contributors) or **branch** from `main` (maintainers).
2. Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b <area>/<short-description>`.
3. Make your change. Keep the diff scoped to one logical concern.
4. **Add tests** for new behavior and error paths — untested new behavior will be sent back.
5. Run the `make ci` merge tier locally.
6. Open a **pull request against `main`**, filling in the
   [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
7. The required Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows CI checks must pass. Address review
   feedback; keep the branch up to date with `main`.

## Merge requirements

`main` is protected. The active repository rules require:

- **CI is green** — the required aggregate confirms the Ubuntu and macOS
  portable CI checks, Windows compile smoke, vulnerability scan, and
  journal-conformance gate pass on the latest commit.
- **Approvals** — none. The required approval count is zero, and
  [CODEOWNER](.github/CODEOWNERS) approval is not required. CODEOWNERS are still
  requested for review, but those requests are advisory.

Required-review enforcement is the repository policy decision tracked in
[#763](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/763). If that decision changes
the repository rules, update this section as part of the same settings change so the
documented and enforced policies do not drift.

Prefer small, reviewable PRs. Squash-merge is the default so `main` stays linear.

## Review rules

These are class-level rules: they exist because the same defect shape has
shipped more than once, so review checks the whole class rather than the
individual instance ([#2081](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/2081)).

### Append-only growth needs a wired bound or pruner

**Rule.** A change that introduces a structure which grows without a natural
end — an append-only file, a database table, an on-disk directory of
per-run/per-item entries, or a long-lived in-memory map or slice — must
identify and **wire** its bound or pruner in the same change. "Wired" means a
running production caller reaches it: a daemon sweep, a retention loop, a
writer that trims on append, or an eviction on insert. A pruner that only an
operator can invoke, or one whose only caller is a test, does not bound
anything.

**Acceptable evidence** — a reviewer should be able to point at all three:

1. **The bound.** A named limit (row/entry count, age window, byte cap, or
   fixed capacity) with a default that applies to a stock configuration, not
   only to a configuration an operator opts into.
2. **The wiring.** The call path from a process that runs unattended to the
   code that enforces the bound. For example, the projection retention loop
   calls `PruneChangeFeed` on every pass
   (`internal/readmodel/retentionloop.go`), and the daemon's retention ticker
   calls `pruneConfiguredTelemetryRetention` and `compactSchedulerRetention`
   (`cmd/goobers/up.go`). Citing the pruner function alone is not evidence;
   cite its production caller.
3. **The test.** A test that grows the structure past its bound and asserts a
   bounded steady state — not merely that the prune function returns without
   error. `TestPruneChangeFeedBoundsGrowth`
   (`internal/readmodel/retention_test.go`) is the shape to copy.

If the bound genuinely belongs in a follow-up, say so in the PR and open the
follow-up issue in the same change; an unbounded structure landing with no
named owner for its bound is a `needs-changes`.

**Incident lineage.** This class keeps recurring in different disguises:
[#2038](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/2038) — the instance
journal and the rollup scheduler tables grew at scheduler-tick rate for the
daemon's lifetime because the only compactor refused to run while a daemon was
up, so a never-restarted daemon never reclaimed anything (the referenced live
journal reached 324 MB);
[#3048](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/3048) — the change
feed's designed 50,000-row bound existed but was not enforced independently of
projection retention, so the bound was documented and inoperative;
[#3049](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/3049) — tombstones
accumulated with no retention policy or deleter at all; and
[#3969](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/3969) — temp
directories orphaned by an OOMKill were never reclaimed because nothing swept
the ones no live process owned. In each case the growth was introduced by a
change that was correct in isolation and the bound arrived later, after the
disk or the startup cost had already become the symptom.

### Closed JSON schemas join the structural drift guard

A new **closed** JSON schema (`additionalProperties: false`) that mirrors a Go
type must join the structural Go-to-schema drift guard **in the change that adds
it** — not in a follow-up. A closed schema rejects an envelope carrying a field
it does not declare, so a field added to the Go producer later becomes a
validation failure at runtime rather than a build failure, and nothing else in
the tree notices the divergence.
[#1700](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/1700)/[#1704](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/1704)
and [#2042](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/2042) — the last
adding `DataSchema` to `journal.Event` with no matching schema property — are
instances of that one class, which is why the rule is structural rather than a
reviewer's memory.

Registration path, both steps in the same change:

1. Register the schema file in [`api/schemas/embed.go`](api/schemas/embed.go):
   in the map naming its contract family (`Envelope`, `Journal`,
   `Notification`), or as an exported constant for a standalone artifact
   schema.
2. Add a fully populated round-trip fixture for it to the `fixtures` map in
   `TestSchemaBackedEnvelopeCompleteness`
   ([`api/validate/envelope_completeness_test.go`](api/validate/envelope_completeness_test.go)).
   The guard asserts every JSON field of the Go value is populated, marshals
   it, and validates the result against the schema, so a Go field the schema
   does not declare fails the merge gate. An entry in `schemas.Envelope` with no fixture
   fails the guard on its own; a schema outside that map — like
   `journal-event` — is covered only once its fixture is added, so add it
   explicitly.

The guard runs in `make ci` (`go test ./api/validate/...`). If a schema
genuinely has no Go producer to drift from, say so in the pull request rather
than leaving the omission unexplained.

### Advertised recovery exits need a registered, tested caller

**Rule.** A change that advertises a way out of a stuck state — an escape
hatch, a rollback path, a self-heal sweep, an unpark of a park/quarantine
state, a forced escalation — must **register** that exit with a production
caller in the same change, and ship a test that demonstrates the recovery path
can actually be invoked. "Registered" means something that runs unattended
reaches the exit for the records that are actually stuck: a daemon sweep, a
post-merge hook, a scheduler pass. An exit whose only caller is a test, whose
only trigger is an operator running a command by hand, or whose trigger the
parked records can never produce, recovers nothing — it only documents an
intention.

**Acceptable evidence** — a reviewer should be able to point at all three:

1. **The exit.** A named function or handler, and the exact stuck state it
   clears, including which records qualify. State the recovery direction the
   exit fails toward when its evidence is missing: an unpark that fails open
   sheds the marker from records that are genuinely still blocked.
2. **The registration.** The call path from a process that runs unattended to
   the exit, plus the trigger that fires it. For example,
   `unparkResolvedSiblings` (`cmd/goobers/postmerge.go`) clears
   `goobers:blocked-on-sibling`, and `performPostMerge` calls it on every
   merged bot PR (same file), so parked PRs shed the label without anyone
   asking. Citing the exit function alone is not evidence; cite its production
   caller. Also check the exit's **reach**: records parked *before* the exit
   shipped, or parked through a different path, are exactly the ones that stay
   stuck forever when the trigger only fires on newly-parked records.
3. **The test.** A test that puts a record into the stuck state, invokes the
   recovery path, and asserts the record actually comes out — not merely that
   the exit function returns without error.
   `TestUnparkResolvedSiblings` (`cmd/goobers/blockedonsibling_test.go`) is the
   shape to copy: it seeds a resolved-blocker PR, a still-blocked PR, and an
   unparked PR, runs the sweep, and asserts exactly which one unparks.

If the caller genuinely belongs in a follow-up, say so in the PR and open the
follow-up issue in the same change; an advertised exit landing with no
registered caller is a `needs-changes`.

**Incident lineage.** This class keeps recurring in different disguises
([#2081](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/2081)):
[#3355](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/3355) — the only
`blocked-on-sibling` unpark iterated pull requests and fired only when a bot PR
merged, so ~60 parked *issues* had no way to shed the label at all;
[#4038](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/4038) — a
cluster-escalated sibling PR had no self-heal exit, permanently starving
`pr-remediation`;
[#4058](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/4058) — a failing-CI
escalation caused by the base never unparked, and the base-advance exit was
inert against a spent budget; and
[#4089](https://github.com/Agent-Clubhouse/Goobers/issues/4089) — a
forced-escalation exit could not reach any record parked before it shipped. In
each case the exit was written, documented, and plausible on inspection; what
was missing was a caller that the stuck records could actually reach, and a
test that would have noticed.

## DSL compatibility policy

The `apiVersion` on configuration resources defines a compatibility line. Within
one `apiVersion`, the following changes are non-breaking and may ship in a minor
release:

- adding optional fields or enum values;
- adding stage or gate kinds;
- relaxing constraints; and
- promoting a DSL feature from `preview` to `ga`.

Removing or renaming a field, tightening a constraint, changing a default, or
changing existing semantics is breaking. A breaking change requires either a new
`apiVersion` or a `deprecated -> removed` lifecycle in
`internal/workflow/features.go` (`ga` features must first transition to
`deprecated`). A feature must remain usable as `deprecated` for at least one
released minor: if it is deprecated in `v1.2.x`, the earliest removal is
`v1.3.0`. Direct `ga -> removed` and `preview -> removed` transitions are
forbidden.

Registry entries retain every lifecycle transition in `Feature.History`; the
current `Level` and `SinceVersion` must match the final transition. Use
`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` release versions (`dev` is reserved for the initial
pre-release baseline). This is the feature-registry's own lineage, distinct
from git release tags: it advances only on a stable tag, never on a SemVer
pre-release tag (`v1.2.3-beta.2` and similar — see `docs/guides/releases.md`
for those). The compatibility guard compares the current registry
with the feature registry executed from the latest canonical SemVer tag
advertised by `origin`. A removal is valid only when that tagged build already
marks the feature deprecated; adding deprecated and removed history in one
change does not satisfy the release window. Before the first tagged release,
the external baseline is empty and no feature may enter `removed`. Registry
validation and `TestFeatureRegistryAgainstLatestRelease` reject rewritten,
skipped, out-of-order, or too-early transitions. Local-only tags are ignored so
stale runner state cannot invent a release baseline. When changing the current
feature matrix, regenerate it with `make docs`.

Whole DSL versions have a separate support window in
`internal/supportmatrix`. After a supported DSL minor is superseded, it must
remain loadable as `supported` or `deprecated` for at least three minor
releases: a version superseded in `v1.1.0` cannot become `unsupported` before
`v1.4.0`. It must also spend at least one released minor as `deprecated`, so a
version deprecated in `v1.3.x` cannot become unsupported before `v1.4.0`;
direct `supported -> unsupported` transitions are forbidden. Keep each
`VersionSupport.History` complete and release-ordered. The support-matrix
policy guard rejects invalid histories and windows. It also compares the
current matrix with the matrix executed from the latest reachable canonical
SemVer tag: released versions and history cannot be removed or rewritten, and
a version may become `unsupported` only when that tagged matrix already marks
it `deprecated`. Adding deprecated and unsupported history in one change does
not satisfy the released-minor window; before the first tag, no version may
become unsupported.

**Current state:** DSL `2.0` is the supported authoring version; every
shipped, reference, and example workflow pins it. DSL `1.4` is `deprecated`
(replacement `2.0`, unsupported after `v0.5.0`) — a workflow pinned to `1.4`
still loads and runs, but `goobers validate` emits a `DVL020` warning. Migrate
a pinned workflow mechanically with `goobers fix --to 2.0`; the only semantic
delta the migrator pins is `automated.pollIntervalSeconds: 10` on gates fed by
a `ci-poll` task, where 2.0's input builder injects that default.

## Binary maintenance policy

The `goobers` **binary** (distinct from the DSL compatibility policy above) is
maintained **forward-only**, as a *resourcing* stance while the team is
small — not an architectural promise (`docs/design/dsl-version-lifecycle.md`
§3.5, DVL-9/#869). We do not cut backport releases of old binaries; a fix
ships in the next release, and you get it by upgrading forward. Upgrading
must never break a pinned DSL version: a newer binary still carries every
interpreter still listed in its `SupportMatrix`.

**PATCH means no author-visible contract change.** A binary release that
fixes interpreter/runtime behavior without changing any DSL version's
observable contract is a patch. If a "fix" changes what a workflow observes,
it is a new DSL minor or major, not a patch — see the DSL compatibility
policy above.

A **frozen** interpreter package (`internal/workflow/v_2_0`, once
`v_3_0` supersedes it in turn) may only receive contract-preserving
patches; a feature or semantic change belongs in a copied-forward
interpreter instead. This is enforced, not just documented: each frozen
package's `testdata/golden/PATCH_LOG.json` pins its `digests.json` by
sha256 and records every reviewed patch, so a compiled-digest change with
no accompanying patch entry fails CI (see that package's `README.md`).

The theoretical case of a correctness/security bug *inside* a frozen
interpreter that authors can't quickly migrate off is intentionally out of
scope for now (design doc §8.7) — with a small team and few coexisting
versions, the answer is fix-forward-and-migrate.

## Commit messages

Use a short imperative subject (`area: do the thing`), a body explaining *why* when it's
not obvious, and reference issues (`Closes #123`). Keep unrelated changes out of the commit.
