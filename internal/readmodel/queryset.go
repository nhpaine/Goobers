// The closed set of supported filter combinations (#1920, design §5.7).
//
// # Why a closed set, rather than "make the filters fast"
//
// §5.7's central finding: **`limit+1` returned rows does not bound rows
// examined**, and neither does an index appearing in the plan. A selective
// residual predicate lets SQLite walk many recency candidates before it finds 51
// matches — which is the current candidate loop relocated into the query
// planner, not removed.
//
// And `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` **cannot prove a residual predicate is absent**.
// SQLite reports `SEARCH run USING INDEX idx_ab (a=?)` while silently evaluating
// `c=?` as a residual filter; the plan output does not enumerate residual terms.
// So the bound cannot come from a plan property. It comes from a finite,
// declared set: every supported combination ships with a covering index, and
// anything unlisted is a typed refusal.
//
// # The set is closed over URL-REACHABLE combinations, not link-reachable ones
//
// This is a correction to the design, recorded in §18.0. §5.7 says the set is
// "generated into the OpenAPI/contract surface so the UI can only construct
// supported combinations". That is false: the portal parses its filters from
// **arbitrary hash query parameters** (`portal/src/routing.ts`), validating enum
// membership but not which *combinations* are legal. Every Insight drill-through
// target is a bookmarkable `#/runs?…` href, so users share and re-enter these
// URLs — and one value, `population=premium-measured`, is reachable ONLY by URL
// and produced by no UI element at all.
//
// So the enumeration below must cover what the router can parse, and the
// refusal must degrade gracefully in the client, because a stale bookmark is a
// normal event rather than a misuse.

// Dim is one filter dimension a list query can constrain.
type Dim string

// The dimensions the run list can be filtered by. These are exactly what
