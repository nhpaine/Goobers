package readmodel

// migrations is the ordered, append-only list of forward migrations applied on
// Open. Never edit a migration once released — append a new one.
// projection_state.schema_version tracks how many have run.
//
// This is deliberately a SEPARATE list from internal/telemetry/rollup's. The two
// stores have different lifecycles: read.db is small, rebuilt as a whole, and
// gated on 191 MB of run events, while telemetry.db is 547 MB gated on 2,263 MB
// of spans (design §5.1). Sharing a migration counter would couple a read-model
// rebuild to an analytics schema change for no reason.
var migrations = []string{
	// v1: the run read model.
	//
	// # Why a separate store at all
	//
	// §5.1: list data is 191 MB and analytics data is 2,263 MB — a 12x difference
	// in rebuild cost between "the data the product IS" and "the data that
	// decorates it". Splitting them means cold start is gated on the former, the
	// two get independent retention policies (which they already need), and
	// read.db stays small enough that rebuild is a whole-store operation.
	//
	// # Why the run row is complete
	//
	// Every column here exists so a list page can be answered with ZERO journal
	// opens (§14.2). Measured today: a 50-row page opens 51 journals, one per
	// returned row, because the row in telemetry.db is not complete enough to
	// answer the list contract and each run must be hydrated from its journal.
	//
	// # Stored phase
	//
	// phase is a STORED, INDEXED fact rather than a reconstruction (§5.4).
	// Deriving it means replaying a run's whole event log, including in the path
	// that counts live runs across all history — measured at 17.2 s to answer
	// "2". It is also what makes a lagging run detectably dirty rather than
	// silently miscategorised, which is the class of defect #1943 is an instance
	// of: removing a completed run's journal currently reclassifies it as
	// *running*, because an absent log replays to zero events.

	// run_stage and then evaluates gaggle and the ordering against the joined run
	// row — which is a residual predicate plus a sort, the exact shape §5.7
	// exists to refuse. §5.5 additionally requires gaggle to be a query predicate
	// rather than a post-filter, so a gaggle-scoped principal that could not
	// combine gaggle with stage would simply lose stage filtering.
	//
	// run_stage.started_at is the STAGE's own start and is a different clock, so
	// it cannot serve run-recency ordering. Hence run_started_at alongside it.

	// The duplication cannot drift: run_stage rows are deleted and rewritten
	// wholesale on every projection of their run (write.go), rather than
	// incrementally maintained.
	//
	// # On the index count
	//
	// Sixteen indexes is the honest price of a closed set: §5.7 requires every

	// would mean either fewer answers or a residual predicate pretending to be
