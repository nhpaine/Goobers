// them here the in-pod rebuild deleted them before the CLI/non-CLI split ever
// ran — GOOBERS_RUN_ID/GOOBERS_WORKFLOW gone, so providerRunContext() fails
// closed and providers.BranchName cannot compose the run branch.
//
// Listing them is safe for a NON-CLI stage by the ordering property below:
// DispatcherControlEnv contains DispatcherRunIdentityEnv, and the strip runs
// after the rebuild, so a plain shell stage still loses them.
//
// It deliberately does NOT name GOOBERS_CRED_* or GOOBERS_REPO_*-by-prefix.
// Resolved credentials never pass through this filter at all: they are minted
// in-pod at stage start and appended to the command's environment AFTER it
// (dispatchexec.go). Naming them here would be an allowlist entry that looks
// load-bearing and is not — and a prefix grant for any image-baked GOOBERS_CRED_*
// besides. The run-context names (GOOBERS_REPO_* and friends) ARE listed, by
// exact name, because those the dispatcher really does stamp; the CLI/non-CLI
// control-plane split still decides whether a given stage keeps them.
//
// A control-plane name reaching this list would be re-admitted here and then
// removed again by the control-plane strip that runs after it, so the ordering
// in stageEnvironment() is what makes this list unable to re-admit the pod
// token BY NAME even if a stage declared `env: {GOOBERS_POD_TOKEN: ...}`.
// By NAME is the whole scope of that claim: kubelet expands $(VAR_NAME) inside
// a container env value against variables declared earlier in the same list, so
// a stage declaring `env: {X: "$(GOOBERS_POD_TOKEN)"}` receives the token's
// VALUE under a name this list legitimately allows. That by-value path predates
