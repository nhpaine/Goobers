// RepassBudget is the repass accounting a single run charges every gate
// evaluation against, and the ONE place the arithmetic behind it lives
// (#3930).
//
// A gate outcome that re-enters an already-completed stage is a repass, and a
// repass is bounded. There are two budgets, not one, and keeping them apart is
// the whole point of the type:
//
//   - POLICY repasses are the reviewer's/checker's judgement that the WORK is
//     not done — a needs-changes verdict, a failing check. They are bounded by
//     the run's inherited MaxRepasses, overridable per gate
//     (runcontrol.MaxRepassesForGate, default 3).
//   - INFRASTRUCTURE repasses (OutcomeInfra) are the producer's own claim that
//     the MACHINERY failed rather than the work — a lost runner, a worktree
//     that would not provision. They are bounded by
//     DefaultMaxInfrastructureRepasses (2) and charged to their own counters,
//     so an environment flake cannot spend the budget a code-review loop needs.
//
// Each budget is kept twice, at two different keys, because they answer two
// different questions:
//
//   - Attempts / InfrastructureAttempts are PER GATE. They are the gate's
//     consecutive non-pass evaluation count in that class — what recovers an
//     interrupted evaluation after a crash and what a gate.started marker
//     numbers. They CROSS-RESET: an infra outcome zeroes the gate's policy
//     count and vice versa, because "three consecutive review failures" stops
//     being true the moment the machinery, not the work, is what failed.
//   - RepassAttempts / InfrastructureRepassAttempts are PER TARGET STAGE.
//     They are the bounded budget itself, cumulative over the whole run for
//     each re-entered stage, because two gates sending the same stage back
//     four times is the same non-convergence as one gate doing it four times.
//     The infra one is cross-reset too, keyed by the gate's declared infra
//     branch: an intervening non-infra outcome means the run made real
//     progress, and the infrastructure retry budget it consumed earlier is
//     returned rather than held against it for the rest of the run.
//
// # Why this is a type and not a method on Evaluator
//
// Both drivers charge it. internal/gate.Evaluator.trackRepass does it for the
// local runner; internal/engine's resolveGateOutcome does it workflow-side for
// the Temporal engine, where the evaluator dispatch is an activity and the
// decision must stay deterministic. The engine's port re-derived the
// arithmetic by hand and collapsed it: infrastructure outcomes were charged to
// the POLICY counter, at the POLICY bound, and were never cross-reset (#3930).
// Nothing failed — every parity row that reaches a retry arm uses a
// status-equals gate, which cannot produce OutcomeInfra at all — so the same
// definition over the same failures escalated at a different point on the two
// runners.
//
// So the arithmetic lives here, once, and both drivers call Charge. It follows
// the shared-constant pattern #624 established for RetryFailureClass and
// BuildLearningEpisode, for the same reason: a second hand-written copy is how
// this diverged.
//
// # Determinism and persistence
//
// Charge is a pure function of (budget state, gate, outcome, target, reentry,
// inherited budget): no clock, no randomness, no I/O, no map iteration. The
// engine holds a RepassBudget as ordinary workflow state and a replay
// reconstructs it from the same deterministic outcome sequence; the runner
// holds it inside the Evaluator and a resume re-seeds it from the journaled
// repassTarget/repassAttempt/gateAttempt annotations. Every map is
// zero-value-usable: a nil map reads as 0 for every key, which is exactly what
// a history recorded before the counters existed must mean.

// the engine from its upstream results map) and neither answer belongs here.
// maxRepasses is the run's INHERITED policy budget; the per-gate leaf override
// is applied here so both drivers resolve it identically.

// gate's per-gate class counters advance on every evaluation, including the
