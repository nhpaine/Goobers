// checkWorkflowsCompile closes the admission gap between canonical config

// the versioned compiler, but the mirror was never complete: compiler-only
// structural rules — an unresolved contextFrom source, a parallel topology
// problem, a dotted state name, incompatible placement across claims-mutating
// stages — were enforced only where something actually called
// workflow.Compile (the CLI and daemon startup), so a GitOps, config-sync, or
// direct-loader consumer of LoadConfigDir got a weaker verdict than the
// daemon it was feeding. Running the real compiler here makes the loader's
// verdict the runtime's verdict by construction, with no second
// implementation to drift.
//
// It runs only on a config this pass has otherwise admitted. The compiler
// aggregates every problem it finds across the whole document — including
// ones the checks above already reported, and ones that belong to the Goober
// or Gaggle a workflow binds rather than to the workflow itself — so on an
// already-invalid config it would restate those findings under a second code
// and a less precise scope. A config that is already rejected loses nothing
// by that: it fails closed either way, and the compiler's remaining findings
// surface on the next pass once the reported errors are fixed.
//
// Compile options mirror the individual wf.Check* calls in checkWorkflow
// exactly — the goober specs, the preview-feature opt-in, and the
// gaggle-level requirement floor. The registries only a running daemon owns
// (known automated checks, known harnesses) stay unset, as they are for those
// checks, so this reports nothing that depends on runtime wiring the loader
