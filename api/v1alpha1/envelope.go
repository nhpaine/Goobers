// This file defines the V0 stage contract: the three canonical wire envelopes
// every stage executor and the runner exchange at runtime. They are plain Go
// types (JSON-tagged) — NOT CRDs — so the runner, stage executors, providers,
// and gate evaluators can import them without pulling in CRD machinery. JSON
// Schemas in api/schemas/ mirror these shapes and are the cross-language,
// closed (additionalProperties:false) contract. See docs/stage-contract.md.
//
// Terminology: a "stage" (ARCHITECTURE.md §5) is what the workflow/task types
// call a "task"; the terms are equivalent. Field names keep the task-flavored
// spelling (taskId, ...) already used by the workflow definition and compiler.
//
// Load-bearing invariant (ARCHITECTURE.md §2.4): stages communicate ONLY through
// envelopes and artifact pointers. No stage reaches into another stage's state.
// The invocation envelope therefore carries context *pointers* (see ContextPointer
// in artifact.go) — never the result bodies of upstream stages.

// StageContractVersion identifies the version of the stage contract these types
// and the api/schemas/*.schema.json documents implement. The schemas are closed:
// unknown fields are a validation error, and additive changes bump this version.
// v1alpha7 adds input-integrity grades to invocations, backlog items, context
// pointers, and artifacts. v1alpha8 adds InvocationEnvelope.CheckoutCones (#649).
// v1alpha9 adds runner-authored nested-agent authority and ownership fields.

// Invocation envelope — what the runner hands a stage when the workflow advances.

// InvocationEnvelope is the standard context block delivered to a stage at
// invocation (agentic via the harness adapter, or to a deterministic stage
// runner). It carries the goal, the isolated workspace, read-only context
// pointers, the declared capability grants, and the stage's static config.
//
// It deliberately carries NO upstream result bodies: a stage consumes prior work
// only by resolving ContextPointers read-only from the journal (§2.4). This makes
// cross-stage state reach-through impossible by construction.
//
// This is a runtime wire envelope, not a Kubernetes object, so it is excluded
// from controller-gen DeepCopy generation (its free-form Inputs map cannot be
// deep-copied generically).
