		"explicit, and never creates or pushes a remote itself. Its `--json` output is\n" +
		"a versioned action envelope:\n\n" +

		"`created` lists paths written in this run; `skipped` lists paths already\n" +
		"present. `nextCommand` is the next command to run. `init --template=quickstart`\n" +
		"materializes `./tutorial-instance` still pointing at the template's\n" +
		"placeholder repository (`your-org/your-repo`); the next step replaces that\n" +
		"with a real one.\n\n" +
		"### Create a disposable repository and connect the instance to it\n\n" +
		"1. Create a new, empty GitHub repository to hold the sample, and push it —\n" +
		"   any name, delete it whenever you're done. With the GitHub CLI:\n\n" +
		"   ```sh\n" +
		"   gh repo create <owner>/<repo> --private --source ./getting-started-task-api --push\n" +
		"   ```\n\n" +
		"   Without it, create the repository at <https://github.com/new>, then:\n\n" +
		"   ```sh\n" +
		"   git -C ./getting-started-task-api init -b main\n" +
		"   git -C ./getting-started-task-api add -A\n" +
		"   git -C ./getting-started-task-api commit -m \"Getting Started sample\"\n" +
		"   git -C ./getting-started-task-api remote add origin https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git\n" +
		"   git -C ./getting-started-task-api push -u origin main\n" +
		"   ```\n\n" +
		"   Already have a disposable repository you'd rather reuse? Skip this step\n" +
		"   and use its `<owner>/<repo>` below instead.\n\n" +
		"2. Create a fine-grained GitHub PAT in\n" +
		"   [GitHub's token settings](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\n" +
		"   **Set Resource owner to the account or organization that owns\n" +
		"   `<owner>/<repo>` (for example, `odsp-microsoft`); keep the default personal\n" +
		"   account when it owns the repository.** Choose **Only select repositories**\n" +
		"   and select exactly the disposable repository. Grant only **Contents: Read\n" +
		"   and write**, **Issues: Read and write**, and **Pull requests: Read and\n" +
		"   write**. For an organization-owned repository, the organization owner may\n" +
		"   need to approve the token before it works; request or wait for approval\n" +
		"   before `connect --seed`. Then export it once under the name `connect`\n" +
		"   expects by default:\n\n" +
		"   ```sh\n" +
		"   export GOOBERS_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token>\n" +
		"   ```\n\n" +
		"   PowerShell:\n\n" +
		"   ```powershell\n" +
		"   $env:GOOBERS_GITHUB_TOKEN = \"<your token>\"\n" +
		"   ```\n\n" +
		"3. Point the instance at the repository, and seed it in the same step:\n\n" +
		"   ```sh\n" +
		"   bin/goobers connect <owner>/<repo> --seed ./tutorial-instance\n" +
		"   ```\n\n" +
		"   `connect` rewrites the placeholder `your-org/your-repo` in\n" +
		"   `./tutorial-instance`'s `instance.yaml` and gaggle config to the repository\n" +
		"   you gave it, records `GOOBERS_GITHUB_TOKEN` (or the name you passed via\n" +
		"   `--token-env NAME`, if you keep the token under a different variable) as\n" +
		"   the credential reference by name only — the value never passes through\n" +
		"   this command — and validates the result in-process. `--seed` derives the\n" +
		"   labels the quickstart workflow's backlog selector requires, ensures they\n" +
		"   exist on the repository, and files one safe starter issue, using that same\n" +
		"   token — one `GOOBERS_GITHUB_TOKEN` export covers connecting and seeding.\n" +
		"   Configuration already pointing at a real repository is left alone unless\n" +
		"   you pass `--replace`.\n\n" +
		"4. Confirm Goobers can see and use your installed harness before the first\n" +
		"   run — `--check-harness` preflights every harness referenced by the\n" +
		"   instance's goobers and prints `HARNESS claude-code: OK` (or `HARNESS\n" +
		"   copilot: OK`) once the CLI is installed and signed in:\n\n" +
		"   ```sh\n" +
		"   bin/goobers validate --check-harness ./tutorial-instance\n" +
		"   ```\n\n" +
		"### Run it\n\n" +
		"```sh\n" +
		"bin/goobers run quickstart ./tutorial-instance\n" +
		"```\n\n" +
		"`run` waits for the run to reach a terminal state by default. This is a real\n" +
		"autonomous run against your disposable repository, so it takes noticeably\n" +
		"longer than the offline demo: it claims one approved issue, implements it,\n" +
		"performs an advisory code-review task, pushes the run branch, and opens a\n" +
		"pull request. It is **not for production**: it intentionally omits CI gates,\n" +
		"remediation loops, bounded escalation, merge policy, and issue close-out so\n" +
		"the onboarding happy path has no stall points.\n\n" +
		"`dashboard` blocks until interrupted, so open it in a second terminal to\n" +
		"browse the run in the Portal, and press Ctrl-C there when you're done:\n\n" +
